	<h2>My collection of various interesting articles/blogs/whatever</h2>

	These are cool blog articles This is a collection of interesting (mostly
	technical) articles i have come across. I _try_ to roughly cluster them and
	some articles may come up twice if i feel like they would fit a certain
	theme nicely or offer another viewpoint on a topic. I might add some small
	comments here and there, but they are only my mindless rambling - feel free
	to ignore.
