		<h2>My collection of various interesting articles/blogs/whatever</h2>

		This is a collection of interesting (mostly technical) articles i have
		come across. I <i>try</i> to roughly cluster them and some articles may
		come up twice if i feel like they would fit a certain theme nicely or
		offer another viewpoint on a topic. I might add some small comments here
		and there, but they are only my mindless rambling - feel free to ignore
		them. Is this actively maintained or up to date in any way? Idk. probably
		not.

	<h3>Some interesting takes on "Make invalid state(s) unrepresentable</h3>
	This is more regarding contracts between APIs (e.g. protobuf, rest) and less
	about your own domain models but you can naturally extend some of the
	arguments to them as well.

	In the context of validation and how to enforce contracts in your app, the
	"parse, don't validate" approach is also important. However, this approach
	is not perfect either, which the second linked article addresses a bit
	(TLDR: Error boundaries become super clear, and your app can always assume a
	"clean slate"; however, the price you pay is that most parsers give really
	bad feedback/error messages, and you lose the ability to handle some special
	cases differently).
